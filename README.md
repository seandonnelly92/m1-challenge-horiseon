_This project was created for module 1 of the Front End Development bootcamp. In this challenge, we were tasked with refactoring code to make it more accessible for a fictional digital consultancy called Horiseon._


# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

This is a simple homepage for the digital consultancy, Horiseon. It outlines the three core services they offer and the three key benefits to potential customers. It was built to convey this information to potential customers in order to generate interest in the business. 

The website allows users to understand what the company offers - at a high level - quickly and easily. 

Accessibility needs have been considered throughout development in order to support those with accessibility needs and in order to improve SEO for the company. 

It has been written in a very traditional way with basic HTML and CSS. There is one JavaScript script in the website footer also. 

Building this simple website has helped me practise and refine my knowledge of some web development fundamentals. One learning that stands out is that there are so many ways to achieve the same outcome. I look forward to learning more about optimisation and efficient coding. 

**Here is the published website URL:** https://seandonnelly92.github.io/m1-challenge-horiseon/index.html

3. Navigate to your downloads folder an Unzip the repository folder. 
4. Move whole folder to a location where you want your project to be stored locally.
5. Open Visual Studio Code
6. Click File > Open Folder... 
7. Navigate to the location where you stored the repository
8. Select the folder
9. Click Open
10. Now you can work on the codebase locally! 

## Usage

Functionality is limited on the website, it mostly just displays information. The nav bar does contain four links: one is the logo which just redirects to the homepage. This will only be useful in future if other pages are added and the nav bar is updated. The other three links in the nav bar are internal anchor tags that scroll the relevant section on the homepage. Provide instructions and examples for use. 

Here is a screenshot of the live website:

## Credits



I would like to thank EdX Skills for Life team including Abdul and all of the TAs for their support so far. 

I would also like thank OpenAI/ChatGPT. I used this to learn how to dynamiaclly include the current year in the copyright notice within the footer, which I believe is a useful piece of functionality. This was done with a JavaScript script.
