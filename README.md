# m1-challenge-horiseon
Module 1 challenge: a website for Horiseon that considers accessibility





# Horiseon Homepage

## Description

This is a simple homepage for the digital consultancy, Horiseon. It outlines the three core services they offer and the three key benefits to potential customers. It was built to convey this information to potential customers in order to generate interest in the business. 

The website allows users to understand what the company offers - at a high level - quickly and easily. 

Accessibility needs have been considered throughout development in order to support those with accessibility needs and in order to improve SEO for the company. 

It has been written in a very traditional way with basic HTML and CSS. There is one JavaScript script in the website footer also. 

Building this simple website has helped me practise and refine my knowledge of some web development fundamentals. One learning that stands out is that there are so many ways to achieve the same outcome. I look forward to learning more about optimisation and efficient coding. 

**Here is the published website URL:** https://seandonnelly92.github.io/m1-challenge-horiseon/index.html#search-engine-optimization 


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
